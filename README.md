# MyScapetuary 🚀✨

Welcome to **MyScapetuary** — a chaotic, glittery tribute to the wildest corners of MySpace back in the day. Think blinking GIFs, neon borders, rainbow cursors, floating backgrounds, and way too much neon… all contained in **one single blog page**.

Built with **Astro**, this project aims to recreate that over-the-top nostalgia while keeping JavaScript minimal and letting HTML & CSS do the heavy lifting.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Fully retro vibe:** Excessive colors, animated backgrounds, and random sparkles.
- **Single-page blog:** One page to rule them all.
- **Minimal JS:** Only enough for cursor effects and background animations.
- **Astro-first:** Leverage Astro’s static site rendering while sprinkling in small client-side effects.
- **Responsive design:** Layout adapts gracefully to smaller screens — profile panel stacks on top of content, top nav scales with width.

## ⚡ Getting Started

All commands are run from the root of the project:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:4321

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## 🛠 Technical Details

- **Astro** handles HTML generation and page layout.
- **Responsive CSS:** Uses CSS Grid and media queries to stack panels under ~520px and adjust top navigation.
- **cursor-effects** adds rainbow cursor trails because why not?
- **Minimal JS frameworks** — everything else is vanilla HTML & CSS chaos.
